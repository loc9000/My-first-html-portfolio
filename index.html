                <h1>About me:</h1>
                <strong><small>I've always loved logic puzzles and brain games. </small></strong>
                <p>I loved playing with legos as a kid and I became obsessed with The Legend of Zelda when Ocarina of Time came out. Each temple was an increasingly difficult puzzle before facing a final boss. <b>Fun facts:</b> my favorite board game is scrabble and I can solve a rubik's cube in about a minute. <br>
                    <br>I want to learn to code becuase I'm fascinated by computers and the internet, but I never explored how they work. During the pandemic, I started doing online tutorials with Python and found it hard to dedicate enough time to teach myself. I decided to make a career change from online customer service doing live chats, calls, and emails for a music store called Reverb.com. <br>
                    <br>I've been playing guitar for 20 years and I've played bass guitar and drums in some really cool bands, linked at the top of this page. I also like to bike, skateboard, and play video games.

                <p>I started taking piano lessons around age 7 because my sister was doing it and I thought it was really cool. I got my first guitar when I was 9. My older sister really got me into all kinds of popular music. In high school, I asked for a drum kit for my birthday and started teaching myself using youtube and playing along with bands like Green Day and Blink 182. <br>
                <br>
                I've mostly played drums in bands. I joined my current band, Close Kept, playing bass. They were a two-piece band of just guitar and drums and had released an EP. We've been playing shows together in Chicago for about 7 years now. Our newest record is being mixed right now and we're releasing it this year. </p>
